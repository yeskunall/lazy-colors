# Lazy Colors

Lazy Colors aims to be a simple tool to give a name to your SCSS color variables. Currently __only__ supports the 140 web-safe colors.

This tool gives you an appropriate name for your color variable so that you don't have to. :smirk:

# Note
While there are plenty of lists with color names mapped to their hex values, I don't quite like the idea of having to name my `red`'s as `red-1` and `red-2` and my `blue`'s as `blue-1` and `blue-2` and so on. That is why I will constantly be working on this repo to update the names for all the different colors I find. Now after reading this, any normal person would conclude that *this* guy over here is cr*aaa*zy. I know this too. There's 6<sup>16</sup> different color combinations possible because of how base-16 works. This is where __you__ guys come in. Think you know of a great name for a particular hex color? Type up a new [issue](https://github.com/yeskunall/lazy-colors/issues) and I'll look into it. If I think the color name is *tacky* and it makes sense to call it that, I will add it to my list of color names.
