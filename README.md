# Lazy Colors

Lazy Colors aims to be a simple tool to give a name to your SCSS color variables. Currently __only__ supports the 140 web-safe colors.

This tool gives you an appropriate name for your color variable so that you don't have to. :smirk:

## Update

Turning this into an __Atom__ package. Stay tuned!
